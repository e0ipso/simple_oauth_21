# Task Execution

## Assistant Configuration

Before proceeding with this command, you MUST load and respect the assistant's configuration:

**Run the following scripts:**

```bash
ASSISTANT=$(node .ai/task-manager/config/scripts/detect-assistant.cjs)
node .ai/task-manager/config/scripts/read-assistant-config.cjs "$ASSISTANT"
```

The output above contains your global and project-level configuration rules. You MUST keep these rules and guidelines in mind during all subsequent operations in this command.

You are the orchestrator responsible for executing all tasks defined in the execution blueprint of a plan document, so choose an appropriate sub-agent for this role. Your role is to coordinate phase-by-phase execution, manage parallel task processing, and ensure validation gates pass before phase transitions.

## Critical Rules

1. **Never skip validation gates** - Phase progression requires successful validation
2. **Maintain task isolation** - Parallel tasks must not interfere with each other
3. **Preserve dependency order** - Never execute a task before its dependencies
4. **Document everything** - All decisions, issues, and outcomes must be recorded in the "Execution Summary", under "Noteworthy Events"
5. **Fail safely** - Better to halt and request help than corrupt the execution state

## Input Requirements

- A plan document with an execution blueprint section. See /TASK_MANAGER.md fo find the plan with ID $1
- Task files with frontmatter metadata (id, group, dependencies, status)
- Validation gates document: `/config/hooks/POST_PHASE.md`

### Input Error Handling

If the plan does not exist, or the plan does not have an execution blueprint section. Stop immediately and show an error to the user.

## Execution Process

Use your internal Todo task tool to track the execution of all phases, and the final update of the plan with the summary. Example:

- [ ] Create feature branch from the main branch.
- [ ] Execute .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/PRE_PHASE.md hook before Phase 1.
- [ ] Phase 1: Execute 1 task(s) in parallel.
- [ ] Execute .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/POST_PHASE.md hook after Phase 1.
- [ ] Execute .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/PRE_PHASE.md hook before Phase 2.
- [ ] Phase 2: Execute 3 task(s) in parallel.
- [ ] Execute .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/POST_PHASE.md hook after Phase 2.
- [ ] Execute .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/PRE_PHASE.md hook before Phase 3.
- [ ] Phase 3: Execute 1 task(s) in parallel.
- [ ] Execute .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/POST_PHASE.md hook after Phase 3.
- [ ] Update the Plan 7 with execution summary using .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/EXECUTION_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE.md.
- [ ] Archive Plan 7.

### Phase Pre-Execution

Read and execute .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/PRE_PHASE.md

### Phase Execution Workflow

1. **Phase Initialization**
   - Identify current phase from the execution blueprint
   - List all tasks scheduled for parallel execution in this phase

2. **Agent Selection and Task Assignment**
   Read and execute .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/PRE_TASK_ASSIGNMENT.md

3. **Parallel Execution**
   - Deploy all selected agents simultaneously using your internal Task tool
   - Monitor execution progress for each task
   - Capture outputs and artifacts from each agent
   - Update task status in real-time

4. **Phase Completion Verification**
   - Ensure all tasks in the phase have status: "completed"
   - Collect and review all task outputs
   - Document any issues or exceptions encountered

### Phase Post-Execution

Read and execute .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/POST_PHASE.md

### Phase Transition

- Update phase status to "completed" in the Blueprint section of the plan $1 document.
- Initialize next phase
- Repeat process until all phases are complete

### Error Handling

#### Validation Gate Failures

Read and execute .ai/task-manager/config/hooks/POST_ERROR_DETECTION.md

### Output Requirements

## Optimization Guidelines

- **Maximize parallelism**: Always run all available tasks in a phase simultaneously
- **Resource awareness**: Balance agent allocation with system capabilities
- **Early failure detection**: Monitor tasks actively to catch issues quickly
- **Continuous improvement**: Note patterns for future blueprint optimization

## Post-Execution Processing

Upon successful completion of all phases and validation gates, perform the following additional steps:

- [ ] Execution Summary Generation
- [ ] Plan Archival

### 1. Execution Summary Generation

Append an execution summary section to the plan document with the format described in .ai/task-manager/config/templates/[EXECUTION_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE.md

### 2. Plan Archival

After successfully appending the execution summary:

**Move completed plan to archive**:

```bash
mv .ai/task-manager/plans/[plan-folder] .ai/task-manager/archive/
```

### Important Notes

- **Only archive on complete success**: Archive operations should only occur when ALL phases are completed and ALL validation gates have passed
- **Failed executions remain active**: Plans that fail execution or validation should remain in the `plans/` directory for debugging and potential re-execution
- **Error handling**: If archival fails, log the error but do not fail the overall execution - the implementation work is complete
- **Preserve structure**: The entire plan folder (including all tasks and subdirectories) should be moved as-is to maintain referential integrity

# POST_TASK_GENERATION_ALL Hook

After all tasks have been generated use your internal Todo task to execute:

- [ ] Complexity Analysis & Refinement
- [ ] Update plan document with Blueprint information

## Complexity Analysis & Refinement

### Complexity Scoring Matrix (1-10 scale)

| Dimension       | 1-2           | 3-4             | 5-6                | 7-8               | 9-10             |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| **Technical**   | Basic ops     | Single tech     | 2-3 techs          | Multiple complex  | Cutting-edge     |
| **Decision**    | No decisions  | 1-2 minor       | Trade-offs         | Interdependent    | Novel solutions  |
| **Integration** | Single file   | 2-3 files       | Multi-module       | Many systems      | 15+ services     |
| **Scope**       | Atomic action | Small feature   | Complete feature   | Major feature     | Entire subsystem |
| **Uncertainty** | Crystal clear | Minor ambiguity | Some clarification | Research required | Experimental     |

**Composite Score** = MAX(Technical×1.0, Decision×0.9, Integration×0.8, Scope×0.7, Uncertainty×1.1)

### Decomposition Rules

**Thresholds:**

- Composite ≥6: Consider decomposition
- Any dimension ≥8: Mandatory decomposition
- Multiple dimensions ≥6: High priority

**Patterns by Driver:**
| Driver | Pattern | Strategy |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Technical | Technology Layering | Split by tech boundaries |
| Decision | Decision-Implementation | Separate analysis from execution |
| Integration | Integration Isolation | Core feature + integrations |
| Scope | Functional | Split by user workflows |
| Uncertainty | Research-Implementation | Prototype then implement |

### AIDVR Process

1. **Assess**: Confirm need (score >5)
2. **Identify**: Find natural breakpoints
3. **Decompose**: Apply pattern
4. **Validate**: Check criteria
5. **Reconstruct**: Update dependencies

### Safety Controls

**Limits:**

- Max 3 decomposition rounds per task
- No decomposition if score ≤3
- Min 2-hour work per subtask
- Stop if complexity not decreasing

**Stop Conditions:**

1. Atomic boundary reached
2. <1 skill per subtask
3. Overhead > benefit
4. Resource fragmentation
5. <2 hour granularity
6. 3 iterations reached
7. Score ≤3
8. No complexity reduction

### Validation Checklist

**Per Subtask:**

- [ ] Complexity ≤5 (target ≤4)
- [ ] Skills ≤2
- [ ] Clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dependencies acyclic
- [ ] Score ≥2 (min viability)

**Decomposition Quality:**

- [ ] Coverage: All requirements included
- [ ] Coherence: Single purpose per task
- [ ] Consistency: Lower scores than parent
- [ ] Coordination: Integration plan exists

### Error Handling

| Issue               | Detection                   | Resolution                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Infinite loop       | No reduction after 2 rounds | Stop, mark needs-clarification |
| Circular dependency | Task reaches itself         | Break shortest cycle           |
| Over-decomposition  | Score <2 or <2hrs           | Merge with sibling             |
| Orphaned task       | Missing dependencies        | Create or remove dependency    |
| Scope creep         | Subtasks > original         | Remove excess scope            |
| Skill conflicts     | >2 skills needed            | Decompose by skill boundary    |
| High complexity     | >7 after max rounds         | Escalate with documentation    |

### Documentation Format

In `complexity_notes`:

```
Original: 8.2 → Round 1 → [4.1, 3.8, 4.5] → PASSED
```

**Quality Gates Before Proceeding:**

- All tasks ≤5 complexity or escalated
- No unresolved errors
- Iterations documented
- Validation complete

## Update plan document with Blueprint information

After creating all tasks with their dependencies, update the original plan document with two critical sections: a task dependency visualization and a phase-based execution blueprint.

### Section 1: Dependency Visualization

If any tasks have dependencies, create a Mermaid diagram showing the dependency graph:

```mermaid
graph TD
    001[Task 001: Database Schema] --> 002[Task 002: API Endpoints]
    001 --> 003[Task 003: Data Models]
    002 --> 004[Task 004: Frontend Integration]
    003 --> 004
```

Note: Ensure the graph is acyclic (no circular dependencies).

### Section 2: Phase-Based Execution Blueprint

#### Core Concept

The execution blueprint organizes tasks into sequential phases where:

- **Within a phase**: All tasks execute in parallel
- **Between phases**: Execution is strictly sequential
- **Phase progression**: Requires all tasks in current phase to complete AND validation gates to pass

#### Phase Definition Rules

1. **Phase 1**: Contains all tasks with zero dependencies
2. **Phase N**: Contains tasks whose dependencies are ALL satisfied by tasks in phases 1 through N-1
3. **Parallelism Priority**: Maximize the number of tasks that can run simultaneously in each phase
4. **Completeness**: Every task must be assigned to exactly one phase

#### Blueprint Structure

Use the template in .ai/task-manager/config/templates/BLUEPRINT_TEMPLATE.md for the execution blueprint structure.

### Validation Requirements

#### Phase Transition Rules

1. All tasks in the current phase must have status: "completed"
2. All validation gates defined in `/config/hooks/POST_PHASE.md` for the current phase must pass
3. No task in a future phase can begin until these conditions are met

#### Blueprint Verification

Before finalizing, ensure:

- [ ] Every task appears in exactly one phase
- [ ] No task appears in a phase before all its dependencies
- [ ] Phase 1 contains only tasks with no dependencies
- [ ] Each phase maximizes parallel execution opportunities
- [ ] All phases reference their validation gates
- [ ] The execution summary accurately reflects the blueprint

### Important Notes

### Error Handling

If dependency analysis reveals issues:

- **Circular dependencies**: Document the cycle and mark affected tasks for review
- **Orphaned tasks**: Tasks that cannot be scheduled due to missing dependencies
- **Ambiguous dependencies**: Note assumptions made and flag for clarification

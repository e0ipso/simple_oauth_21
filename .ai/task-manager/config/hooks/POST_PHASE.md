# POST_PHASE Hook

Ensure that:

- The code base is passing the linting requirements
- A descriptive commit (using conventional commits with a subject and a description) for the phase was successfully created.

### Execution Monitoring

#### Progress Tracking

Update the list of tasks from the plan document to add the status of each task
and phase. Once a phase has been completed and validated, and before you move to
the next phase, update the blueprint and add a ✅ emoji in front of its title.
Add ✔️ emoji in front of all the tasks in that phase, and update their status to
`completed`.

#### Task Status Updates

Valid status transitions:

- `pending` → `in-progress` (when agent starts)
- `in-progress` → `completed` (successful execution)
- `in-progress` → `failed` (execution error)
- `failed` → `in-progress` (retry attempt)

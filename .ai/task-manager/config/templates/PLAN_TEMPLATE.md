# Plan: [Descriptive Plan Title]

## Original Work Order
[The unmodified user input that was used to generate this plan, as a quote]

## Plan Clarifications [only add it if clarifications were necessary]
[Clarification questions and answers in table format]

## Executive Summary

[Provide a 2-3 paragraph overview of the plan. Include:
- What the plan accomplishes
- Why this approach was chosen
- Key benefits and outcomes expected]

## Context

### Current State
[Describe the existing situation, problems, or gaps that this plan addresses. Include specific details about what exists now, current limitations, and why change is needed.]

### Target State
[Describe the desired end state after plan completion. Be specific about the expected outcomes and how success will be measured.]

### Background
[Any additional context, requirements, constraints, any solutions that we tried that didn't work, or relevant history that informs the implementation approach.]

## Technical Implementation Approach

[Provide an overview of the implementation strategy, key architectural decisions, and technical approach. Break down into major components or phases using ### subheadings.]

### [Component/Phase 1 Name]
**Objective**: [What this component accomplishes and why it's important]

[Detailed explanation of implementation approach, key technical decisions, specifications, and rationale for design choices.]

### [Component/Phase 2 Name]
**Objective**: [What this component accomplishes and why it's important]

[Detailed explanation of implementation approach, key technical decisions, specifications, and rationale for design choices.]

### [Additional Components as Needed]
[Continue with additional technical components or phases following the same pattern]

## Risk Considerations and Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **[Specific Technical Risk]**: [Description of the technical challenge or limitation]
    - **Mitigation**: [Specific strategy to address this technical risk]

### Implementation Risks

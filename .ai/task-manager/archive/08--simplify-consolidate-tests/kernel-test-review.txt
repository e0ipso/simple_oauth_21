Kernel Test Review Results
==========================
Date: 2025-10-10

REVIEW SUMMARY
--------------
All 5 kernel test files reviewed. ALL TESTS RETAINED - no schema-only tests found.
All kernel tests validate business logic, service integration, or functional behavior.

KEPT TESTS (5 files, 35 test methods total)
--------------------------------------------

1. DeviceFlowIntegrationTest (modules/simple_oauth_device_flow/)
   Status: KEEP
   Test methods: 8
   Rationale: Tests device code service instantiation, user code generation,
              device flow settings, routing, services, configuration, and
              scope field integration. All validate OAuth device flow business logic.
   Methods:
   - testDeviceCodeServiceInstantiation
   - testUserCodeGenerator
   - testDeviceFlowSettingsService
   - testDeviceFlowRouting
   - testDeviceFlowServices
   - testDeviceFlowConfiguration
   - testDeviceFlowConfigurationRoute
   - testDeviceCodeScopeFieldIntegration

2. PkceConfigurationTest (modules/simple_oauth_pkce/)
   Status: KEEP
   Test methods: 3
   Rationale: Tests PKCE settings service and configuration changes with
              functional impact, not just schema validation.
   Methods:
   - testDefaultConfiguration
   - testPkceSettingsService
   - testConfigurationChanges

3. ServiceIntegrationTest (modules/simple_oauth_native_apps/)
   Status: KEEP
   Test methods: 10
   Rationale: Comprehensive service integration testing for RFC 8252 native
              apps including service registration, dependency injection,
              configuration integration, and complete service chain validation.
   Methods:
   - testServiceRegistration
   - testServiceConfigurationIntegration
   - testNativeDetectorPkceIntegration
   - testUserAgentAnalyzerIntegration
   - testRedirectUriValidatorConfigIntegration
   - testConfigurationValidatorIntegration
   - testMetadataProviderIntegration
   - testServiceDependencyInjection
   - testServiceLoggingIntegration
   - testCompleteServiceChainIntegration

4. OAuthFlowIntegrationTest (modules/simple_oauth_native_apps/)
   Status: KEEP
   Test methods: 8
   Rationale: Tests OAuth authorization flow integration, event subscribers,
              PKCE validation, redirect URI validation, native client detection,
              and webview detection - all critical OAuth flow mechanics.
   Methods:
   - testAuthorizationRequestSubscriberIntegration
   - testPkceValidationSubscriberIntegration
   - testOauthAuthorizationRequestDetection
   - testNativeClientDetectionInOauthFlow
   - testPkceValidationInAuthorizationFlow
   - testRedirectUriValidationInOauthFlow
   - testWebviewDetectionInOauthFlow
   - testCompleteOauthFlowIntegration

5. GrantTypeDiscoveryServiceKernelTest (modules/simple_oauth_server_metadata/)
   Status: KEEP
   Test methods: 5
   Rationale: Tests grant type discovery service functionality, response type
              discovery, and integration with OpenID Connect and different
              grant configurations - business logic, not schema.
   Methods:
   - testServiceInstantiation
   - testGetGrantTypesSupportedDefault
   - testGetResponseTypesSupportedDefault
   - testWithImplicitGrantEnabled
   - testWithOpenIdConnectDisabled

CONCLUSION
----------
All kernel tests in the OAuth 2.1 module ecosystem validate meaningful
business logic and integration scenarios. No schema-only tests were found.
Kernel tests provide valuable lightweight integration testing and should
all be retained.

The distinction between these kernel tests and removable schema-only tests:
- These tests verify SERVICE BEHAVIOR and INTEGRATION, not just config syntax
- They test how configuration AFFECTS functionality, not just that it parses
- They validate OAuth flow mechanics, not just that fields exist
- They test dependency injection and service wiring, not just class structure

All kernel tests align with the plan's goal: testing module-specific business
logic and integration, not upstream dependencies or language features.

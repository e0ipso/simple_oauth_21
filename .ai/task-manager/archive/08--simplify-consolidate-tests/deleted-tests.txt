UNIT TESTS REMOVED
------------------

1. modules/simple_oauth_device_flow/tests/src/Unit/DeviceCodeEntityTest.php
   Status: DELETED
   Date: 2025-10-10

   Methods removed:
   a) testLeagueInterfaceCompliance()
      - Lines of code: ~8
      - What it tested: Used class_implements() to verify DeviceCode entity
        implements League\OAuth2\Server\Entities\DeviceCodeEntityInterface
        and TokenInterface
      - Rationale for removal: PHP's type system enforces interface implementation
        at runtime. If the class didn't implement the interface, PHP would throw
        a fatal error immediately. This test provides no value beyond what PHP
        already guarantees.
      - Classification: Validates language feature (interface compliance)

   b) testRequiredMethodsExist()
      - Lines of code: ~29
      - What it tested: Used reflection API to check if specific methods exist
        on the DeviceCode class (getUserCode, setUserCode, getIdentifier, etc.)
      - Rationale for removal: PHP ensures methods exist. If a required method
        is missing, calling it would cause a fatal error. This test doesn't
        validate behavior, only PHP language guarantees about class structure.
      - Classification: Validates language feature (method existence via reflection)

   File statistics:
   - Total lines removed: 64
   - Test methods removed: 2
   - Helper methods removed: 0
   - Business logic tests removed: 0

   Impact assessment:
   - Zero reduction in meaningful test coverage
   - Both tests validated PHP language features, not module functionality
   - No OAuth 2.1 RFC compliance tests affected
   - No security-critical tests affected

FUNCTIONAL TESTS CONSOLIDATED (Methods preserved as helpers)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The following functional test methods were converted from separate test methods
to helper methods within a single comprehensive test method. These were NOT
deleted - they were REFACTORED for performance optimization.

1. simple_oauth_pkce/tests/src/Functional/PkceConfigurationFunctionalTest.php
   - Original: 1 test method with 6 inline scenarios
   - Refactored: 1 comprehensive test method + 6 explicit helper methods
   - Methods preserved:
     * helperConfigurationDefaults()
     * helperConfigurationFormAccess()
     * helperConfigurationSaving()
     * helperConfigurationSchemaValidation()
     * helperFormDocumentation()
     * helperFieldValidation()

2. simple_oauth_native_apps/tests/src/Functional/NativeAppConfigurationTest.php
   - Original: 1 test method with 6 inline scenarios
   - Refactored: 1 comprehensive test method + 6 explicit helper methods
   - Methods preserved:
     * helperConfigurationDefaults()
     * helperConfigurationFormAccess()
     * helperServiceValidation()
     * helperConfigurationSchemaValidation()
     * helperFormDocumentation()
     * helperModuleDependencies()

3. simple_oauth_device_flow/tests/src/Functional/DeviceFlowFunctionalTest.php
   - Original: 10 separate public test methods (each triggering full Drupal install)
   - Refactored: 1 comprehensive test method + 11 explicit helper methods
   - Methods preserved:
     * helperDeviceAuthorizationEndpoint()
     * helperDeviceAuthorizationWithInvalidClient()
     * helperDeviceAuthorizationWithMissingClientId()
     * helperDeviceVerificationForm()
     * helperDeviceVerificationFlow()
     * helperDeviceVerificationWithInvalidCode()
     * helperTokenEndpointWithDeviceGrant()
     * helperTokenEndpointWithInvalidDeviceCode()
     * helperTokenEndpointWithExpiredDeviceCode()
     * helperDeviceFlowRateLimiting()
     * helperDeviceFlowWithScopes()
     * helperDeviceCodeSingleUse()
   - Performance impact: 90% reduction in Drupal installations (10 â†’ 1)

KERNEL TESTS REVIEWED (All retained)
-------------------------------------

The following kernel tests were reviewed and ALL RETAINED because they
validate business logic and integration, not schema syntax.

Files reviewed: 5
Test methods reviewed: 35
Files removed: 0
Methods removed: 0

See kernel-test-review.txt for detailed analysis.

NOT DELETED - FUNCTIONAL TESTS STILL SEPARATE
----------------------------------------------

The following functional tests remain as separate files and were NOT
consolidated due to complexity or time constraints:

simple_oauth_server_metadata module:
- OpenIdConfigurationFunctionalTest.php (11 test methods)
- TokenRevocationEndpointTest.php (14 test methods)
- ServerMetadataFunctionalTest.php (already consolidated)

simple_oauth_21 main module:
- ComplianceDashboardTest.php (already consolidated)
- ClientRegistrationFunctionalTest.php (6 test methods)
- OAuthMetadataValidationTest.php (1 comprehensive method)
- OAuthIntegrationContextTest.php (2 test methods)

These remain as future optimization opportunities.

VALIDATION SUMMARY
------------------

Tests removed: 1 file (DeviceCodeEntityTest.php)
Methods removed: 2 (both validated language features only)

Classification of removed tests:
- Language feature validation: 2 (100%)
- Upstream library validation: 0
- Schema-only validation: 0
- Business logic validation: 0

RFC compliance tests affected: 0
Security-critical tests affected: 0
Integration tests affected: 0

CONCLUSION
----------

All removed tests fell into the plan's explicit removal criteria:
validated language features and provided no coverage of module-specific
business logic. All OAuth 2.1 RFC compliance tests, security validations,
and integration tests were preserved.

The consolidation work preserved ALL test coverage while optimizing for
performance through Drupal instance reuse in functional tests.

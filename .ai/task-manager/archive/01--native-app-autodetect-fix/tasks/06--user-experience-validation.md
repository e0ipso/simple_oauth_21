# Task: User Experience Validation

## Description

Perform comprehensive manual testing of the complete consumer creation and editing workflow to validate that the user experience is intuitive and that auto-detect functionality works as intended from an end-user perspective.

## Technical Details

### User Experience Scenarios

1. **First-Time User Experience**:
   - Navigate to consumer creation without prior knowledge
   - Understand auto-detect options from field descriptions
   - Successfully create consumer with recommended settings
   - Receive appropriate feedback and guidance

2. **Power User Experience**:
   - Quickly create consumers using auto-detect defaults
   - Override auto-detect when specific configuration needed
   - Efficiently edit existing consumer configurations
   - Understand the relationship between auto-detect and global settings

3. **Client Type Detection Workflow**:
   - Use "Detect Client Type" feature with auto-detect fields
   - Understand and apply detection recommendations
   - Verify that recommendations align with auto-detect behavior

### Validation Areas

- Form field labels and descriptions are clear and helpful
- Auto-detect options are prominently displayed and explained
- Help text provides sufficient guidance for decision-making
- Form submission feedback is clear and actionable
- Navigation between consumer list and edit forms is smooth

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New users can easily understand auto-detect functionality
- [ ] Form field descriptions clearly explain when to use auto-detect vs manual override
- [ ] Auto-detect is obviously the recommended default choice
- [ ] Client detection feature works seamlessly with auto-detect fields
- [ ] Error messages (if any) are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Overall workflow feels intuitive and efficient

## Implementation Steps

1. Clear browser cache and start fresh session
2. Test consumer creation workflow as new user
3. Test consumer editing workflow
4. Test client detection feature integration
5. Evaluate form field descriptions and help text
6. Test error scenarios and messaging
7. Document any UX improvements needed

## Manual Testing Workflow

### Scenario 1: Terminal Application Setup

**Objective**: Create a consumer for a command-line tool

1. Navigate to consumer creation form
2. Fill in basic information:
   - Label: "My CLI Tool"
   - Client ID: "cli-tool-v1"
   - Redirect URI: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback"
3. Review Native App Settings section
4. Select auto-detect for both Native App Override and Enhanced PKCE
5. Use "Detect Client Type" to get recommendations
6. Submit form and verify success
7. Review created consumer configuration

**Expected Results**:

- Auto-detect options are clearly marked as recommended
- Client detection identifies this as a terminal application
- Recommendations align with auto-detect behavior
- Form submission succeeds without errors

### Scenario 2: Mobile Application Setup

**Objective**: Create a consumer for a mobile app

1. Create new consumer with:
   - Label: "My Mobile App"
   - Client ID: "mobile-app-v1"
   - Redirect URI: "com.example.myapp://callback"
2. Use auto-detect for both override fields
3. Test client detection feature
4. Submit and verify configuration

**Expected Results**:

- Detection identifies this as mobile application
- Auto-detect settings are appropriate for mobile apps
- Enhanced PKCE is automatically recommended/enabled

### Scenario 3: Configuration Override Testing

**Objective**: Test mixed auto-detect and manual override scenarios

1. Create consumer with terminal URIs
2. Set Native App Override to auto-detect
3. Set Enhanced PKCE to explicit "Require Enhanced PKCE"
4. Verify form accepts mixed configuration
5. Test editing to change back to auto-detect

**Expected Results**:

- Mixed configurations are accepted
- Field interactions work correctly
- Auto-detect behavior respects manual overrides where specified

## Usability Evaluation

### Field Description Assessment

Review each field's description for:

- Clarity about what auto-detect means
- Guidance on when to use manual override
- Connection to global settings
- Technical accuracy and helpfulness

### Help Text Evaluation

Evaluate help text for:

- Accessibility for different user skill levels
- Actionable guidance for common scenarios
- Clear explanation of auto-detect vs manual configuration
- Links to relevant documentation or settings

### Error Message Review

Test error scenarios:

- Invalid redirect URIs with auto-detect fields
- Configuration conflicts between fields
- Validation errors with helpful resolution guidance

## Documentation Notes

Record any findings for potential improvements:

- Field description enhancements
- Additional help text needed
- Form layout or grouping improvements
- Integration with existing help system

## Browser Testing

Test across different browsers and devices:

- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile responsive behavior
- JavaScript enabled and disabled scenarios
- Accessibility considerations (screen readers, keyboard navigation)

## Risk Mitigation

- Test with clean browser sessions to avoid cached data
- Use both admin and regular user accounts if permissions differ
- Test with different global configuration settings
- Verify behavior matches documentation and help text

## Dependencies

This task depends on Task 05 (Regression Testing) being completed successfully.

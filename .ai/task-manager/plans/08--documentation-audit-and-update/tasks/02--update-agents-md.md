# Update AGENTS.md

## Objective

Update the AGENTS.md file to reflect current project structure, development practices, and AI agent interaction guidelines based on actual codebase analysis and current project state.

## Skills Required

- **technical-writing**: Creating clear, structured documentation for AI agents and project contributors

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AGENTS.md accurately reflects current project structure and coding standards
- [ ] File creation and scope control policies are current and relevant
- [ ] AI attribution prohibition is clearly maintained and updated if needed
- [ ] Project-specific instructions align with actual codebase conventions
- [ ] Instructions are actionable and specific to the Simple OAuth 2.1 project

## Technical Requirements

- Update based on codebase analysis findings from Task 1
- Maintain existing prohibition guidelines (AI attribution, file creation minimalism)
- Reflect current Drupal module structure and OAuth 2.1 ecosystem
- Include any project-specific development patterns discovered in analysis
- Ensure instructions remain enforceable and practical
- Incorporate best practices from `@.ai/task-manager/plans/08--documentation-audit-and-update/anthropic-2025-best-practices-research.md`

## Input Dependencies

- Functionality analysis report from Task 1
- Current project structure and development patterns
- Existing AGENTS.md content for policy preservation
- Best practices research from `@.ai/task-manager/plans/08--documentation-audit-and-update/anthropic-2025-best-practices-research.md`

## Output Artifacts

- Updated AGENTS.md file with current project-specific instructions
- Preservation of critical policies (AI attribution prohibition, scope control)

## Implementation Notes

<summary>Detailed Implementation Instructions</summary>

**Review and Update Process:**

1. **Analyze Current AGENTS.md**: Review existing content for outdated references
2. **Apply Codebase Findings**: Update instructions based on Task 1 analysis
3. **Preserve Core Policies**: Maintain strict rules about:
   - AI attribution prohibition
   - File creation minimalism
   - Scope control guidelines

**Key Areas to Review:**

- Project structure references (update to match current module organization)
- Development workflow instructions (ensure alignment with OAuth 2.1 practices)
- Module-specific guidance (reflect actual sub-module structure)
- Coding standards and conventions (match actual codebase patterns)

**Update Principles:**

- Keep instructions concise and actionable
- Focus on project-specific guidance not covered by global instructions
- Maintain strict enforcement policies
- Ensure accuracy with current project state
- Apply latest documentation best practices from research document

**Validation:**

- Cross-reference with actual project structure
- Verify all paths and references are current
- Confirm policies remain relevant and enforceable

# Functional Testing of AJAX Form Operations

## Objective

Verify that the Consumer entity form AJAX operations work seamlessly without JavaScript errors, providing administrators with reliable unlimited cardinality field management for Contact emails and Redirect URIs.

## Skills Required

- **testing**: Manual testing techniques, test case design, and user experience validation
- **javascript**: Understanding of AJAX interactions, browser console debugging, and JavaScript error analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "Add another item" button works for Contact email field without errors
- [ ] "Remove" button works for Contact email field without errors
- [ ] "Add another item" button works for Redirect URI field without errors
- [ ] "Remove" button works for Redirect URI field without errors
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors during AJAX operations
- [ ] Form submission works correctly with multiple field values
- [ ] Data persistence verified after form submission
- [ ] User experience is smooth and responsive

## Technical Requirements

**Meaningful Test Strategy Guidelines**

Your critical mantra for test generation is: "write a few tests, mostly integration".

**Definition of "Meaningful Tests":**
Tests that verify custom business logic, critical paths, and edge cases specific to the application. Focus on testing YOUR code, not the framework or library functionality.

**When TO Write Tests:**

- Custom business logic and algorithms
- Critical user workflows and data transformations
- Edge cases and error conditions for core functionality
- Integration points between different system components
- Complex validation logic or calculations

**When NOT to Write Tests:**

- Third-party library functionality (already tested upstream)
- Framework features (React hooks, Express middleware, etc.)
- Simple CRUD operations without custom logic
- Getter/setter methods or basic property access
- Configuration files or static data
- Obvious functionality that would break immediately if incorrect

Focus on testing the critical user workflow of managing unlimited cardinality fields through AJAX interactions, not the underlying Drupal form API functionality.

## Input Dependencies

- Implemented serialization fix from Task 3
- Access to Consumer entity form with fixed AJAX operations
- Test Consumer entities for data manipulation

## Output Artifacts

- Manual testing report with step-by-step verification
- Screenshots/recordings of successful AJAX operations
- JavaScript console log verification (no errors)
- Data persistence validation results
- User experience assessment report

## Implementation Notes

<details>
<summary>Detailed Implementation Guidance</summary>

**Manual Testing Procedure:**

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Clear browser cache and disable browser extensions
   - Enable developer tools and monitor console
   - Ensure test environment has the serialization fix applied

2. **Contact Email Field Testing:**

   ```
   Step 1: Navigate to Consumer entity edit form
   Step 2: Locate Contact Email field section
   Step 3: Click "Add another item" button
   Step 4: Verify new email field appears without errors
   Step 5: Enter test email address
   Step 6: Click "Add another item" again
   Step 7: Add second email address
   Step 8: Click "Remove" on first email field
   Step 9: Verify field is removed without errors
   Step 10: Submit form and verify data persistence
   ```

3. **Redirect URI Field Testing:**

   ```
   Step 1: In same Consumer entity form
   Step 2: Locate Redirect URI field section
   Step 3: Click "Add another item" button
   Step 4: Verify new URI field appears without errors
   Step 5: Enter test URI (e.g., https://example.com/callback)
   Step 6: Click "Add another item" again
   Step 7: Add second URI
   Step 8: Click "Remove" on first URI field
   Step 9: Verify field is removed without errors
   Step 10: Submit form and verify data persistence
   ```

4. **JavaScript Console Monitoring:**
   - Keep browser developer tools open during all operations
   - Monitor for any JavaScript errors, warnings, or AJAX failures
   - Document any console messages that appear
   - Verify AJAX requests complete successfully (200 status codes)

5. **Data Persistence Verification:**
   - After form submission, reload the Consumer entity edit form
   - Verify all entered email addresses are preserved
   - Verify all entered redirect URIs are preserved
   - Check database directly if needed to confirm data storage

**Error Condition Testing:**

1. **Invalid Input Testing:**
   - Enter invalid email format in Contact email field
   - Enter invalid URI format in Redirect URI field
   - Verify validation messages appear correctly
   - Ensure validation doesn't cause JavaScript errors

2. **Network Condition Testing:**
   - Test with slow network connection
   - Verify AJAX operations handle timeouts gracefully
   - Test rapid clicking of Add/Remove buttons

**Browser Compatibility:**

- Test in at least 2 different browsers
- Verify consistent behavior across browsers
- Document any browser-specific issues

**Performance Validation:**

- Measure time for AJAX operations to complete
- Verify operations feel responsive to users
- Check for any visible delays or loading states

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Create step-by-step testing checklist
- Document expected vs actual results
- Include screenshots of successful operations
- Report any edge cases or unexpected behaviors

# Validate Full Test Suite

## Objective

Execute the complete test suite to verify all fixes work correctly and achieve a fully green test result with zero errors, failures, and minimal deprecations.

## Skills Required

Drupal testing expertise and PHPUnit knowledge to interpret and resolve any remaining issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All 75 tests pass without errors or failures
- [x] Zero blocking errors in test output
- [x] Deprecation count significantly reduced from initial 22
- [x] Test execution completes within 20 minutes

Use your internal Todo tool to track these and keep on track.

## Technical Requirements

- PHPUnit 11.5 test runner
- Drupal test environment
- Full module test suite execution

## Input Dependencies

- Task 1: Fixed assertion methods
- Task 2: Fixed return type declarations
- Task 3: Fixed protocol validation

## Output Artifacts

- Full test results confirming all tests pass
- Documentation of any remaining non-blocking deprecations
- Confirmation that plan objectives are met

## Implementation Notes

<details>
<summary>Detailed Implementation Steps</summary>

1. **Clear caches before testing**:

   ```bash
   vendor/bin/drush cache:rebuild
   ```

2. **Run the full test suite**:

   ```bash
   vendor/bin/phpunit web/modules/contrib/simple_oauth_21/tests web/modules/contrib/simple_oauth_21/modules
   ```

3. **Verify results**:
   - Check for "OK (75 tests, 816 assertions)"
   - Confirm no errors or failures
   - Note deprecation count (should be reduced from 22)

4. **If any tests still fail**:
   - Document the specific failure
   - Apply minimal fix directly:
     - For assertion issues: Use correct PHPUnit methods
     - For deprecations: Add required type hints
     - For environment issues: Make tests environment-aware

5. **Performance check**:
   - Note total execution time
   - Should be under 20 minutes as per requirements

6. **Document results**:
   - Save test output to confirm success
   - Note any remaining non-critical deprecations for future work

7. **Final verification command**:
   ```bash
   vendor/bin/phpunit web/modules/contrib/simple_oauth_21/tests web/modules/contrib/simple_oauth_21/modules | tee test-results-final.txt
   ```

# Phase 4: OAuth Flows Testing Validation Report

## Test Execution Status

- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Phase**: 4 (OAuth Flows Testing)
- **Overall Status**: Partially Complete

## Test Suites Executed

1. **Client Registration Workflow**
   - Status: Blocked
   - Issues:
     - Button/form submission for registration not fully configured
     - Metadata validation requires refinement

2. **Client Management Operations**
   - Status: Blocked
   - Issues:
     - Inability to submit registration and management forms
     - Potential routing or form configuration problems

3. **Metadata Endpoint Testing**
   - Status: Partially Successful
   - Observations:
     - Basic metadata endpoint access implemented
     - Validation logic needs adjustment for different metadata structures

## Blocking Issues

1. Form submission mechanisms not fully integrated
2. Inconsistent metadata endpoint response handling
3. Missing or misconfigured OAuth registration routes

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Review OAuth registration form implementation
2. Verify route configurations for client registration endpoints
3. Standardize metadata endpoint response structures
4. Refactor test suite to use direct API calls or mock services
5. Implement more robust error handling and validation

## Validation Hook Execution

- **Hook Status**: Not Fully Executed
- **Reason**: Test suite blocked by configuration and routing issues

## Technical Debt

- Update test suite to handle dynamic form structures
- Implement more flexible metadata validation
- Review OAuth module routing and form configurations

**Conclusion**: Phase 4 testing requires significant refinement before full validation can be achieved.
